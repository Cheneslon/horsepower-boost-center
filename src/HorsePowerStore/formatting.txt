Structure
	Fields go at top
	Constructors go after fields
	When reasonable, break up long lines
	Write method summaries at top for all methods
	Always use default indentation (use CTRL+K, CTRL+D when you're done editing)


Naming Conventions
	JavaScript: Fields, Parameters, Methods are camelCased; classes are PascalCased
	C#: All Pascal, All The Time
		- except for parameters and variables
	Every function should be a verb
	Don't use parent class names when naming methods
